            My name is Kate Clemens. 
            <br> I am a senior at the <strong>University of Missouri</strong> studying Information Technology and Business. I graduate in December of 2022. I enjoy troubleshooting and solving problems! As an undergraduate, I have gained IT experience in and outside the classroom. I have earned two certifications from the College of Engineering; Information Systems and Web and Mobile Applications.
            <br>
            <br>
            I was a camp and online instructor for iDTech, a nationwide technology camp for students K-12th grade. I had the oppurtunity to teach a wide variety of technology courses. I also worked as a process analyst for Allstate Insurance Company. Specifically, within their Technology Acquisition Team. I had the opportunity to learn how a large corporation stores, maintains, and governs their technology portfolio. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I am currently a software support specialist for IBMs Information Server Support Team. I get to help customers in all types of industries utilize a powerful data integration tool. I enjoy continuous learning in all things tech. Tech is the future, and i'm excited to contribute to its growth!
