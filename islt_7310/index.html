         <p>Welcome to my portfolio website! By the end of this digital interaction, I hope you will have gotten to know me a tad better.</p>

         <p>The purpose of this website is to get a sense of who I am beyond my paper resume. Just four short years ago I was envisioning where a girl like me could fit in the tech industry. I was introduced to computer science in my senior year of high school. It changed my directory in an instant. I chose to study technology in college and wondered what I could do with it in the future. Would I be developing applications? Helping solve real-world problems? Inspiring others like me? I am happy to share I have had the opportunity to do all three! Thanks to the IT program at the University of Missouri, I have been shown endless opportunities to advance my career. From attending technology conferences across the country, participating in STEM outreach, to working at a top 10 tech company! I have been equipped with the tools needed to begin my journey. I welcome you to explore my website and feel free to reach out and ask questions through my contacts page.</p>
