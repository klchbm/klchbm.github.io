        <h3>About Me</h3>
        
        <p>
            My name is Kate Clemens. I am a senior at the <strong>University of Missouri</strong> studying Information Technology and Business. I graduate in December 2022. I enjoy troubleshooting and solving problems! As an undergraduate, I have gained IT experience in and outside the classroom. I have received two certifications from the College of Engineering. Information Systems and Web and Mobile Applications. I was a camp and online instructor for iDTech. I taught a wide variety of technology courses to K-12th graders. I worked as a process analyst for Allstate Insurance Company. Specifically, within their Technology Acquisition Team. I had the opportunity to learn how a large corporation stores, maintains, and governs their technology portfolio. 
            <br/>I am currently a software support engineer for IBMs Information Server Support Team. I get to help customers in all types of industries utilize a powerful data integration tool. I enjoy continuous learning in all things tech. Tech is the future, and how neat we get to contribute to its growth!
