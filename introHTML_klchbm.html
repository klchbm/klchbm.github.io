    Hi fellow Web Design and Development classmates. My name is Kate. I am a senior studying information technology. I have taken one web development class prior to this (INFOTC 2830). I find learning HTML and CSS fun. I enjoy troubleshooting and solving problems. I look forward to creating a resume or portfolio website for this class. I have never used GitHub to host a website and I’m excited to learn. I find user experience and how people interact with websites interesting. It would be neat to learn more about UX. I reside in Columbia, Missouri and am from the north suburbs of Chicago. After 4 years, I am still not use to Missouri’s heat. On my free time I enjoy cooking new things, drawing, and going to Stephens Lake Park! I like to spend time with my family. Especially with my niece and nephew who are 6 and 3.
