            iDTech: June 2019 to May 2020, I worked for iD Tech as an Online and Camp Instructor. During the summer I worked at two locations: Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois and Loyola University in Chicago, Illinois. iD Tech hosts tech camps across the country. They specialize in providing education in tech from ages seven to nineteen. As an iD Tech Instructor, I was responsible for creating engaging, skill-building, and inspirational courses. I conducted over 200 lessons including virtually and in person. I delivered high quality instruction and dove into a variety of technology topics. (Assemble Take Home Pi-Top: Python Coding, Robotics and AI with Cozmo: Java Coding, Building Custom Mods, Blocks, and Maps in Minecraft). I Instructed 5 groups of all girl classes monthly in partnership with Nokia to increase female participation in STEM. (HTML & CSS, Introduction to Programming, Lego Robotics, Photoshop, Unity, and 3D Modeling with Blender). I created custom lesson plans, presentations, and activities for each client. Other courses I taught included Animation and 3D modeling with Maya, Minecraft Modding, Python, Roblox Studio, Scratch, Video Production and YouTube.

            Allstate Insurance Company: June 2020 to May 2021, I was a Process Analyst at Allstate Insurance Company. I worked in their Enterprise Architecture office on their technology acquisition process. I collaborated with architects to optimize their intake process by gathering and analyzing stakeholder requirements. I leveraged facilitation skills to capture feedback on user experience, data quality, and cost savings. I proposed the improved intake process to chief architects that was later implemented and used by key areas within Allstate. I mapped software to their business capability model to achieve important insights. I Executed application portfolio management. I facilitated lifecycle retirements of eight-five technology assets – saving operating expense. I gained experience working in an agile environment. I led meetings around continuous development on team projects. I collaborated not only with my team, but multiple areas of the business to gain clear direction and gain feedback.
