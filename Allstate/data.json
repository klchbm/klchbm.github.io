This will be a plug-in app that will reside on the Salesforce CRM platform.FastForm has a drag and drop editor that allows to create custom forms very quickly and deploy it within the Arity pages. It also has the capability for e-signing if the form requires acceptance of policy or terms of condition.  The data will reside within the SalesForce (multi-tenant) Allstate account. Only a handful of internal Arity personal will have access to the collected data. The main audience of this data will be Arity marketing / sales team including account managers and system administrators. Arity/Allstate employees' Access to the Stored Data in Salesforce platform.For added security, the Arity team conducts a formal periodic & systematic audit of user licenses to confirm continued need for access & revoke when necessary,  within several hour’s notice. This audit process has been reviewed & approved for use (via a Salesforce.com audit completed last year by Allstate Internal Audit team, working with ATSV).Access permission is revoked (within a few hours's notice) by administrators when the team learns about Arity employees leaving the company or being transferred to another department/teams. Currently around 100 users within ARITY and Allstate have visibility into these incoming leads and data. However system administrator can limit access permission/visibility of the customer leads using profiles and other system rules on an \"need-to-know\" basis.Availability and Platform SLA: Will be tied to the SalesForce account as this is a plug-and-play application.
