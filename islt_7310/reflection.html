                <p class=first-letter>Over the course of my college career, I stuck with a mentality of “why not me?”. This motto allowed me to apply for positions I thought I’d never get. It motivated me to take on projects I never thought I could do! Often being 1 of 4 girls in classes of 30, doubting my abilities was a common habit. Through determination, reflection, and support of mentors, I continued to overcome challenges like these.</p>

                <p class="a">I have found a sense of purpose and fulfillment in the work that I do. Working as an instructor for iDTech was a fulfilling role for me. I was able to show kids the fundamentals of coding and watch them use their unique creativity to build games, applications, and animations! Working at Allstate showed me how vital technology is for a large company. I got to surf through thousands of software products and help determine whether to retire or renew them. Now at IBM, I get to work with clients in every industry to ensure our software products are running at peak performance. I am excited to bring all the skills I have learned into my next project!</p>
            
                <p class="a">Soon, I hope to be in a position where I get to use my technical skills to help companies on a global scale. I want to become a subject matter expert on technology software that enhances business productivity. Artificial Intelligence will streamline many business processes we see today. Software support specialists, like myself, will need to ensure the software is working as intended. With the technical and soft skills, I have gained, I believe I would be a good fit.</p>

                <p class="a">Knowledge and experience are key components needed when applying for new jobs. But what I personally find to be the MOST important is attitude. Technology is ever evolving. It is impossible to know it all! Approaching challenges with curiosity, reaching out for help, and using informative resources are all great techniques for finding practical solutions to problems.</p>
